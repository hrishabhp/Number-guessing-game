# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple "guess the number" game built in Python. It's a classic command-line project for practicing fundamental concepts like loops, conditions, and user input.

## Features

* The user gets *10 attempts* to guess the secret number.
* The game provides *"higher"* or *"lower"* hints after each incorrect guess.
* A "Congratulations" message is shown for a correct guess.
* If the user runs out of attempts, the game reveals the secret number.

## How to Play

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Run the number guessing game problem.py file using a Python interpreter:
    bash
    python "number guessing game problem.py"
    
3.  The game will prompt you to enter a guess.
4.  Keep guessing based on the "higher" or "lower" feedback until you win or run out of attempts!
